                <p class="list-group-item text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">My school is a very big one and it has a very modern canteen. It is perhaps the most popular place in the school. It becomes very busy during the break times very difficult to find a seat to sit on during those times, so we have to stand and eat.
                    Our school canteen is very well equipped. One can buy almost every kind of snack there, like samosas, chips, sandwiches, sweet, cakes etc. They are prepared in very hygienic surroundings by our school cook, and tables to sit on and eat, and ovens to keep the food warm. There is also a soda fountain which is Very popular among the older students.

                    All the students love to sit in the canteen and discuss the events of the day. The noise level is always very high in the canteen as everyone is shouting to make himself heard. There are notice boards and suggestion boxes which all students are freely. There is also a separate enclosure for teachers. The cook charges very reasonable rates from us.

                    I think that the school canteen is my favorite place in the school. I always enjoy myself there, and look forward to the recess when I can rush to the canteen with my friends.
